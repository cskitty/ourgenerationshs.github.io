Abortion. A widely controversial topic that has been hotly debated and discussed, especially in the past year with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. 

Since ancient times, abortions have been performed through a number of methods. Common practices include herbal abortifacients, sharp tools, or traditional medicine that date back to ancient China, Egypt, India, and the Roman Empire.

With abortion’s extensive history in so many cultures, it is no surprise that laws were also put in place regarding this practice. At different points in time, Japan, China, India, and ancient Rome all had bans placed on abortions with varying levels of severity. 

But why do people ban abortions? Religious followers vehemently quote from the Old Testament, which states that life starts at conception; thus, aborting a fetus would result in murder. Some medical scholars refer to the Hippocratic Oath, stating that it prevents them from performing abortions. Even today, anti-abortionists sport a wide range of reasons that only they can justify. 

In this month’s issue, we address today’s most pressing issue regarding abortion: Roe v. Wade. You will get to read the two sides of this topic, as well as a timeline regarding the history of abortion, and eventually form your own educated opinion on the ethics of abortion.

in conclusion…:
China
Abortion is accessible to all women, in public and private hospitals countrywide. There is not much debate surrounding the morality of it, as traditional Chinese beliefs perceive the right to live as starting at birth.

India
Abortion is legal for rape victims and in case of severe fetal anomaly, but it requires a long process of approval, resulting in it being inaccessible to many people.
U.S.
The legality of abortion depends on the states. As of now, many states are split between protecting abortion and making it illegal.
Indonesia
Abortion is legal in medical emergencies, as well as in cases of severe fetal anomaly. It's also legal for cases of rape before six weeks of gestation have passed. The process is severely complicated and ambiguous, and many people are unable to obtain an abortion. For every 100,000 live births, there are 305 maternal deaths.
Pakistan
Policies are generally against abortion, except in ambiguous cases of "good faith" or "necessary treatment". Many women attempt to get unsafe abortions, which majorly contributes to avoidable injuries and death. In 2002, 197,000 women were estimated to have been hospitalized for unsafe abortion complications.
Nigeria
Abortion laws in Nigeria have not changed since 1861. They remain illegal, unless done to save the life of a pregnant woman. Around 50.6 per 1,000 women of reproductive age attempt to get an abortion, making it one of the highest rates in the world.
Brazil
Many women attempt to buy Misoprostol on the black market in order to get an illegal abortion. Abortion is legal only to save a woman's life, or if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest. Unsafe abortions are the fourth leading cause of maternal deaths in the country.
Bangladesh
Abortion is only legal to save a woman's life. However, Menstrual Regulation, which is used to bring back regular menstruation, is available. Many women are unaware of this, and gestational limits are unclear, which causes many people to be incorrectly denied when attempting to find Menstrual Regulation care.
Russia
Abortion is legal on request until the 12th week of pregnancy, and it is also available in later pregnancies under special circumstances.
Mexico
There are no national-level regulations on abortion. 8 out of 32 states, as well as Mexico City, are working on providing safe paths to abortion.
