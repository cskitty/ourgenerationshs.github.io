Should religion and state be separated and why? To what degree?
  
  The term hijab originated from the curtain in prophet Muhammed’s house that separated his wives’ residential lodgings from the main house, where visitors come. In present day, hijab refers to the head covering worn by Muslim women as a piece of clothing mandated by law in majority of the countries in the Middle East, including Iran and Afghanistan. The recent death of Mahsa Amini in custody of the morality police has brought the hijab controversy to the forefront of international news, as it is the primary reason behind the imprisonment and death of Amini. The religious morality police in Iran arrested her for not properly wearing a hijab. Her death sparks controversy as it forces us to reconcile the weight religion should hold in a nation. All in all, Religion and state should be separated, because people can control governments, but not religion. Government is fluid while religion is set in stone.
