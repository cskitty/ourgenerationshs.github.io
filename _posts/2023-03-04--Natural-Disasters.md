Threatening to strike at any place and time, an earthquake is a rapid shaking caused by the shifting of rocks underneath the earth’s surface. In order to prepare your home for such a phenomenon, fasten all bookcases and shelving to walls. Place large, heavy, and fragile objects on lower shelves. Know where the electricity, gas, and water switches and valves are so they can be shut off quickly. Once an earthquake starts, it is important that everyone knows how to react. Create, practice, and follow an emergency plan that includes safe places where everyone can take cover, like a sturdy piece of furniture. If it starts while you are inside a car, pull over and stop, making sure to set the parking brake. Turn on the radio for emergency broadcast information as well. If outdoors, stay away from any buildings or tall trees and find an open area. In coastal areas, make sure to find higher ground as a tsunami could pose threats to your home and family. Finally, if inside, avoid running outside and don’t stand under doorways. Drop to the ground, cover your head and neck, and hold onto something sturdy.

If a fire starts in one’s home, they may only have two minutes to gather their loved ones and escape. A fire is a natural disaster that can strike unexpectedly, which is why it is important to be prepared. Smoke alarms should be installed in every level of the home. These alarms must be tested once a month, because if they are not, the people of the household will not be alerted in the case of a fire . Additionally, every household must have an emergency escape plan. Even if the alarms work, residents may not survive the fire if they don’t designate a meeting place and don’t have knowledge of the safest way to evacuate. Not only should households be prepared for fires, but they should also take steps to prevent them. For example, smoking indoors was the leading cause of home fire deaths from 2014 to 2018. These statistics should convince smokers to avoid doing so while indoors. Furthermore, cooking with negligence poses a fire hazard. Be attentive,: stay close to the kitchen while food is cooking, and make sure flammable items are 3 feet away from the stovetop.

Fatalities can also occur because of human interaction with the environment. Lung cancer, respiratory infections, and heart disease: these are all diseases caused by air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, 2.4 million people die each year from air pollution. Human activity, especially in highly populated cities, is the major cause of this issue. Citizens should take steps to protect the environment and reverse these detrimental effects. For example, using less energy such as electricity and gasoline will directly help with the global problem of air pollution. Turning off the lights or shutting off the TV are simple habits that prove to be impactful. Some home appliances, like light bulbs and stoves, use more energy than others, so avoid energy-hungry appliances. Solar power is also an excellent way to reduce emissions, as solar panels don’t release greenhouse gasses. Even while on the road, drivers can reduce their carbon footprint by opting for climate-friendly electric cars and leaving. Additionally, children and teens can either take public transportation or carpool on the way to school.

Though tragedy threatens to strike at any moment, we can take steps to prevent these deaths.
