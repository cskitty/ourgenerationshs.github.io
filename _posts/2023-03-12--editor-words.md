Hello, we’re the Editors in Chief of Our Gen! Thank you for reading the March 2023 issue of Our Gen. Our goal for our club is to connect the teenagers in our current digital age to major current issues to help us further understand and care about the world around us. As writers, artists, and editors, our team has delved into current issues, connecting them back to our lives. Understanding earthquakes in Turkey is extremely important, and so is understanding how the natural fundamental environmental issue is affecting the entire world, including our homes. For example, California fault lines provide a dangerous possibility for earthquakes up to a magnitude of eight. In cases such as this, we believe that it is important to educate teenagers about these natural disasters so we can better protect ourselves and perhaps, one day, to be able to protect the human race from those deadly disasters.

We want to thank our amazing team for their hard work on this issue, our advisor Mrs. Chung for her constant support, and a special thank you to Ms.Tekin for inspiring us to take action and to influence others regarding the Turkey earthquakes. Our Generation reminds us how closely connected people are, and how even a small positive remark can leave a huge trace in someone’s lives.

With this, we hope our readers will take away the importance of understanding our world. Our Generation creates a platform for teenagers to utilize their voices and actions. Even more so, we would like to encourage and empower young adults to become agents of change and to make those positive impacts for our society. We, young adults, can shape the future. We are the future.

Sincerely,  
Chanah Y. & Melody Y.
