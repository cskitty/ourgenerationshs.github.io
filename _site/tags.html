At this moment, both sides of the stadium scream their war cries for blood and pain. None of them know of the blood and sweat laid underneath to fuel their dream. Qatar forced countless people to their deaths building their extravagant stadiums. According to Qatari officials, there were “between 400 and 500” deaths among workers at World Cup stadium construction sites. The workers shout for rights, help, and basic freedom all around Earth. Four hundred to five hundred construction worker deaths in Qatar while preparing for the 2022 FIFA World Cup have been widely reported and criticized. The country has faced criticism for inadequate working conditions and labor laws, with some workers facing exploitation, long hours, and hazardous working environments. According to human rights organizations, hundreds of workers have died while working on World Cup-related infrastructure projects. The Qatari government has made efforts to improve working conditions, but more needs to be done to ensure the safety and rights of all workers in the country. The international community, FIFA, and corporations with ties to World Cup projects have a responsibility to advocate for fair and safe working conditions in Qatar, as well as for all workers around the world.

    "body": "2023/02/28 - As one of the most important sporting events in the world, the FIFA World Cup in Qatar had over 5. 4 billion viewers. Since the announcement of the Qatar World Cup in December 2010, construction and preparation commenced to make the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East possible. Immigrants from India and Africa built stadiums, secured safety of the games, and provided service, acting as a crucial factor that allowed the World Cup to take place. A total of two million migrant workers helped to facilitate the process, but among them, over 6,500 people have died due to poor living and working conditions, highlighting the underlying problem behind the World Cup and exposing the larger topic of worker abuse. The FIFA World Cup was not the first example of abuse of migrant workers as the root of the problem can be traced back to the last century. A significant factor contributing to workers’ abuse in Qatar is the Kafala System, or the Sponsorship System. Originally adopted in the 1950s, this system legally binds foreign workers to their employers, leaving the workers prone to manipulation and without the ability to escape such abuse. While the system was originally created to enhance regulation between employers and migrant workers, this policy now only takes away migrant workers’ freedom and makes them dependent on their employers. For instance, employers were responsible for renewing migrant workers’ resident permits, which the workers themselves had no control over. However, when the permits failed to be renewed, the workers then became the victims that had to bear the consequences themselves. Furthermore, the employers also had the power to cancel workers’ permits, demonstrating the power disparity which dismisses the laborer’s human rights and causes the workers to be stuck in a cycle of abuse. Furthermore, other prohibitions such as passport confiscation prevent workers from leaving the country, adding onto the problem. The lack of labor unions and labor laws in the society also shows problematic judicial and legislative practices that are hostile to migrant workers. Collectively, the system in Qatar made the migrant workers prone to labor exploitation, leaving them vulnerable during the FIFA World Cup. During the construction of the stadiums, the two largest problems the workers faced were wage delay and injustice. Amnesty International revealed that 100 employees of Qatar Meta Coats were not paid any wages for as long as seven months. In response to this, FIFA stated that they were unaware of this issue, implying that they failed to take cases of human rights abuses linked to the World Cup seriously. Moreover, even when workers were paid wages, the amount they received was extremely minimal. Ironically, while Qatar had spent nearly $220 billion on new infrastructure for the World Cup, they had kept labor costs low for the migrant workers. In addition to low wages, migrant workers in Qatar received lack of proper recognition for their deaths, and the true causes of their deaths were hidden by the responsible committees. In fact, while there have been 37 deaths that were directly linked to construction of World Cup stadiums, 34 of them were classified as “non-work related”. In many other examples, the deaths were covered up as “natural death” in order to conceal the workers’ abuse. Regarding this issue, ongoing protests and public reforms were also important in dictating the prospect of migrant workers’ future. In 2017, the Qatar government signed an agreement with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to prevent labor exploitation and adhere labor practices to the international standards. This marks a sign for positive change, but it will not be effective until it is properly enforced. However, in many cases, weak implementation limits the impact of beneficial legislation to the workers. For instance, the Workers’ Welfare Standards provides restrictions on worker abuse and was meant to protect the workers under abuse, nevertheless examples of exploitation remained prevalent. Targeting the sponsorship system, the country ended the exit permit requirement in 2018 and allowed the workers to have the freedom to leave. Overall, many advancements have been made to improve the workers’ access to justice, health and safety, and wages, but in order to maintain a positive trend, there needs to be increased monitoring and detection of abuse. It is necessary for companies to respect the human rights of all workers equally for the abuse of migrant workers to one day come to an end.

As one of the stadiums for the FIFA World Cup, Stadium 974 witnessed Korea’s loss to Brazil and elimination, Serbia failing to advance after losing 2-3 to Switzerland, and Poland narrowly making the round of 16 after a losing to the t eventual champion Argentina. As these moments are dramatic and historic in their own way, Stadium 974 is equally historic in its advancement of sustainable stadiums. Stadium 974 is the first “dismountable” stadium ever built for the World Cup, and it is special for the notable use of 974 shipping containers in its construction, with their interior space being used for important functions such as bathrooms. The 974 is unique because it is the number reflecting the international dialing code of Qatar, which symbolizes a sense of welcome to other nations. It hosted seven games in the FIFA World Cup, consisting of six group stages games, and one game in the round of 16, showing its significance in the event. Stadium 974 is a part of Qatar’s plan to host a carbon neutral world cup, though various analyses express skepticism toward that claim. Still, Stadium 974 attempts to achieve that claim through designing and building a modular stadium that can be dismounted per-order and shipped to other locations and countries to be reassembled into a functional sports venue. This feature of reassembling addresses a specific issue that comes with constructing stadiums for major sporting events, which is when venues fall into disuse after the initial event. Such a building is also referred to as a “white elephant,” and it brings many associated environmental problems In the past, the issue of disused stadiums has occurred in many countries. For example, the Olympic Aquatics Stadium in Rio De Janeiro has had very little activity after Brazil hosted the Olympic games in 2016. The Obi Stadium in South Africa that hosted FIFA World Cup matches fell into disrepair after 2010, and the Baseball stadium in Athen met a similar end after the 2004 Summer Olympics as well. These examples highlight the issue with hosting major sporting events and there are not many instances where such big stadiums are required. Therefore, when the sporting events end, people rarely use them. Furthermore, governments also willfully stop funding stadium maintenance in some cases because of the high cost, leaving the stadiums to deteriorate. This results in an environmental issue because the construction of stadiums also emits a lot of greenhouse gasses that worsen climate change. The Carbon Market Watch estimates that Qatar emitted 1. 6 Megatonnes CO2 equivalent, illustrating the magnitude of the problem. Fortunately, stadium 974 theoretically solves this problem because the Qatari government can disassemble it when there are no sporting events that require this addition to the seven other stadiums. It can also be shipped to another country where an additional stadium might be needed, maximizing its convenience. This prevents the stadium from falling into disuse and stretches the utility of the carbon emission invested into the building of this stadium. However, Qatar did not provide clear plans for the future of Stadium 974, so the true potential of Stadium 974 remains ambiguous. Further, the impact of carbon emission of Stadium 974 is not only affected by its modular design and ability to be transported, but also the distance that it is shipped. Overall, although Stadium 974’s current future is ambiguous, it brings the issue of carbon emission associated with stadium construction into consideration, while also setting an example of a potential solution.

    "body": "2023/02/26 - During the Industrial Revolution, America transformed from an agricultural country to an industrialized one. With the emergence of large industrialists such as John D. Rockefeller with his Standard Oil company and Andrew Carnegie controlling the entire Steel industry, politicians and industrialists often neglected workers’ working conditions. Their tactic of promoting the overall economic growth has simultaneously caused serious problems such as a bigger gap of wealth and the inhumane treatment to the workers. Therefore, in response to all these intolerable regulations, workers stood up for themselves and together formed workers cooperative and labor unions. On an ordinary day of 1894 in a factory in Chicago, a worker’s strike broke out in George Pullman’s railroad cars manufacturing factory. The potential causes behind the strike serve as a reminder to the public of the worsening working conditions for the lower class workers. Different from what he has always been advertising about, Pullman treated his workers badly with very minimum wage and bad working conditions (“Pullman Strike”). To make things worse, Pullman decided to cut the wage again to further exploit his employees. In reaction to this impersonal treatment, the workers in the American Railway Union (ARU) fought back. The leader of this strike was Eugene V. Debs, who was the president of ARU. He condemned Pullman’s action, and compares him to the slave owners (“The Strike of”). Debs believed that all workers should cooperate together to fight against big industrialists and for their own working conditions. Deb served six months in jail after the strike; however, this movement has brought this critical social issue to the publics’ attention. All of this led to the establishment of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which guaranteed the workers right to join a labor union. While other people ignored workers, Debs has always been fighting against the inhumane treatment in the industries, serving as an important reformer in the workers history. While Debs was imprisoned, Mary Harris Jones stood out for him and supported Pullman’s strike. Mother Jones was an Irish immigrant; after her husband and children died, she joined and supported the workers strike. She has helped African American workers to obtain their rights, held opposition to child labor, and also proposed a shorter working time. Most prominently, she has devoted to fight for the abolition of child labor. In the year of 1903, she joined a march with mill workers and child laborers from New York City to President Theodore Roosevelt’s Long Island home to advocate for their economic justice (“Mother Jones”). She once said that “today the white child is sold for two dollars a week to the manufacturer” in order to satirize the purposes of the industries for using those extremely cheap child labor. Her fierce reforms led to new child labor laws, which prevented children under 14 from working. These laws are still in place to this day to protect children from physical damage at a young age as well as their educational opportunities.

    "title": "America’s Immigrant Farm Workers",
    "body": "2023/02/25 - From the beginning Immigrants built America and continues to power it, making up more than a third of workers in some industries. They continue to improve our economy, creating companies around two times faster than American-born citizens. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, immigrants added approximately $2 trillion to the United States’ GDP in 2016 while contributing around $458. 7 billion to taxes in 2018. The National Immigration Forum reported that “employment-based immigrants are critical to the U. S. economy as they meet the temporary and permanent needs of U. S. employers in diverse industries”. The importance of immigrant workers is shown especially in terms of food production on our farms. However, despite their importance to our economy, these immigrant farm workers struggle to make ends meet as they face danger and are treated without concern for their wellbeing both on and off of the fields. According to the USDA’s Economic Research Service, about 73% of our current agriculture workers are immigrants, driving $1. 053 trillion in the farm industry and placing food on our tables for families. America’s farms are mainly located in California, Iowa, Texas, Minnesota, and Nebraska. This means that the produce that is grown in these five states are the majority of the food that ends up on America’s tables and the immigrants working on those fields keep the industry going and America fed. They face dangers everyday while working with the heavy machinery and pesticides that are used throughout the seasons. For example, in drier states such as California, wildfires are almost a constant danger and add risk for these immigrant workers on our fields. The smoke and heat of these uncontrollable flames damage the crops, and inhaling smoke and chemicals can lead to negative impacts on the workers’ physical and mental health. In 2017, wildfires in Napa and Sonoma destroyed around 500 acres of wine grapes and caused about $75 million of economic damage. Overall, immigrant workers on farms feed our families and everyday, they face danger from potential natural disasters. On top of this, the employers of these immigrant workers often take advantage of their contracts and undermine their basic human rights. The workers struggle to feed their families, find proper housing, receive low wages, are excluded from basic workers’ rights protection laws, are unable to receive proper education, and face physical, psychological, and sexual abuse out on the fields. An immigrant worker named Patricia M. reports that one of the foremen at the farm she worked on repeatedly raped her until she became pregnant and was able to file for a lawsuit. Even after these acts of assault ended, it left her traumatized and “the rape continues to affect her”. Many of the workers are undocumented or on a guest visa, such as the H-2A visa, that allows employers to hire people from out of the country, forcing workers to live with the threat of being potentially deported constantly hanging over their heads. Also, on top of that, the wages that are provided are extremely low. A family of immigrant farm workers usually earn around $25,000 at most, even including other sources of income. This limits them in their housing options, forcing them to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions without basic utilities and in extremely isolated areas. Furthermore, the average immigrant farmworker only receives up to an 8th grade education, and children as young as twelve years old work in the fields for around thirty hours a week. In some of the worst cases, these people who are living in extreme poverty are vulnerable to human trafficking and can be coerced into paying a ridiculously high price in exchange for being helped to cross the border. With this debt, these people are now forced to work and with the high prices of food and housing and the low wages, the cycle never ends. Immigrant farmworkers are an essential part of the United States’ economy, making it all the more necessary that employers help them meet their necessary and basic needs. However, they often are not and even access to seemingly simple things like bathrooms and basic sanitation are hard to access. With the added precautions from COVID-19, conditions for immigrant workers continue to be devastating and add to the struggles that they face.

    "title": "Gender Inequality in Industries",
    "body": "2023/02/24 - Gender equality in the workplace has been a concern since the 19th century. Since then, the number of working women has risen astronomical amounts. However, this change is not exclusively positive; with the idea of a male “sole provider” becoming more and more obsolete, the male presence in the workplace has diminished significantly. Since 2010, the number of women on payroll has surpassed that of men (Wall Street Journal). Through the number of men working in industries and, more specifically, education, the declining presence of men in the workplace is visible. Prior to the 19th century, men were the only people in the workplace, yet this imbalance has drastically changed. While women have been pushing for equal rights and joining the workforce, the number of men considered to be in prime working age from 25-45 have been declining since the 60s (NPR). With the number of women on payroll being higher than that of men since 2010, there has been a lack of motivation to keep working for male workers. HEAL (health, education, administration, and literacy) had once been a male dominated area; now, the opposite now rests true. Due to this, there have been feeble attempts at encouraging men to keep working. However, not much has been done as men nowadays earn less than most men in 1979 (with inflation taken into account). Additionally, most men that are not working – whether teenagers or those in the prime working age – are not aware of this issue (NPR). These issues could stem from the education system, but not for the reasons one might think. Education has had a major impact on the number of men in the workplace. Decades ago, teaching had been a male dominated profession; now only 1 in 10 high school teachers are male, partly due to the fact that it’s seen as a low reward profession (The Atlantic). This decline dates back to the 20th century, when in 1980, 40% of teachers were male; since then, the number has only gone down. Not seeing any men in the workplace while growing up contributes to the lack of motivation for males joining the workforce as well. Without anyone to relate to or consult, many men find it difficult to visualize their future in the workplace (NPR), especially when high schools rarely take the time and effort to display working men. The number of men in the workforce has visibly declined tremendously in the past few decades due to the lack of motivation and education. Books like Richard Reeves’s Of Boys and Men have tried to tackle and bring awareness to this issue, however little has been done to resolve it. Men are struggling to find their place in the workplace, and the numbers of employed men in the prime working age needs to rise; if not, as the numbers keep going down, the presence of male workers will be non-existent.

    "title": "Amazon's Worker's Rights (or lack of them)",
    "body": "2023/02/23 - For years, Amazon has been at the forefront of controversy about the treatment of its workers. Though the company denies its infractions of workers rights, critics have exposed how detrimental these working conditions are. Studies by the Strategic Organizing Center note that Amazon’s “obsession with speed” puts the workers in danger. When workers fall under the pressure of meeting stringent production quotas, their risk of injury increases. Nearly one in five of Amazon’s delivery drivers suffered injuries in 2021. This injury rate alarmingly increased by 40% from last year’s. This obsession with speed is also apparent in the way that they strictly monitor their employees. Workers are constantly criticized for “idle time”, even if it lasts for just a few minutes. An Amazon spokesman has revealed: “Performance is only measured when an employee is at their station and logged in to do their job. ” However, Darren Westwood, an Amazon worker, highly condemns these policies. He has revealed his distress about how even his bathroom breaks are tracked and the way that managers constantly question him about his idle time. Amazon had aspired to control its workers even further by patenting a design for a wristband that tracks the workers’ locations and “nudging” them in the direction of their next assignment, creating a tight schedule and toxic work environment. Due to ethical issues, Amazon abandoned this patent, but the spirit of this bizarre concept lives on. Recently, on December 27 2022, 61-year-old Rick Jacobs died at the Amazon DEN4 warehouse in Colorado Springs, Colorado, yet instead of moving the body, managers created a makeshift barrier around the deceased worker using cardboard bins, outrageously claiming that this act would avoid distracting other employees from work. Witnesses were shocked by the “blatant disregard of human emotions at this facility”. An anonymous worker discloses: “No one should have been told to work alongside a dead body, particularly after witnessing it…[we received] no warnings before walking into the building”. Another asks: “Do you think we could not have had a little respect and shut down long enough to at least get the body out of the facility and clean up after him before people are milling around like nothing’s happening?” Amazon’s disregard for the well-being of its workers also applies economically. On January 25, 2023, Amazon warehouse workers in rhe UK staged their first-ever strike over pay and working conditions. Staff were angered with the pay increase of just 50 pence per hour. Workers claim that the 5% pay increase fails to match the inflation of living costs and want a minimum £15 an hour. Some of the staff are working up to 60 hours a week just so they can meet mortgage payments. Westwood revealed to CNBC: “Someone the other day said we’re treated like robots—no, robots are treated better”. Bogdan, another participant in the strike, said that this extremely low pay offer insulted staff. He chose to join the strike because he wanted the public to “understand what is going on” behind the scenes every time they choose the convenience of Amazon. Though Amazon attempts to cover up these situations and portray themselves as a perfect corporation, one must accept that these events are a reality that threaten workers rights to safety and economic stability.

    "title": "South African Erosion of Workers’ Rights",
    "body": "2023/02/22 - The single-room tin homes of South Africa’s 500+ townships are testaments to the radical inequality that remains as a legacy of Apartheid, South Africa’s past oppressive system of government which enforced racial segregation. Almost 30 years post-Apartheid, South African wealth distribution is still vastly unequal. The various attempts to redistribute wealth have created a slightly more diverse yet still highly exclusive upper economic echelon which excludes the vast majority of the population. Adding on to the concerning economic and social status of South Africa, jobs are scarce with the unemployment rate at around 43% and people are desperate. Consequently, any work is coveted by those trapped in poverty, and competition for job slots is immense. This desperation facilitates the exploitation of economically disadvantaged South Africans, and the rendering of labour laws null and void. There are three major reasons for this: the desperation of the workers, the wage of labour, and the weak South African government. Firstly, in South Africa, there are a number of labour laws meant to implement a meaningful minimum wage and protect menial labour workers. However, a vast number of labourers are desperate enough to work for anything and as a result, the sanctity of labour laws is largely non-existent. Many workers will accept short-term work which brings in cash quickly, but are not sustainable jobs. As such, employers don’t feel the same level of responsibility for the wellbeing of their employees, and often get away with underpaying and overworking individuals. Secondly, there is an issue surrounding the culture of menial labour in South Africa - there is a running joke among immigrants from first world countries that labour is “free”, because the comparative price of having three full time domestic workers barely begins to reach the cost of hiring an au-pair to watch your children for a week in the US. Consequently, almost all South African middle and upper class households will employ at least one full time worker to do tasks from cleaning the house to raising the children. These low standards of payment for domestic workers and with a set minimum wage of R23. 19 (less than $1. 40), has made it very difficult to reshape salaries for South African manual labourers. As a result, escaping poverty is highly unlikely and extremely hard for workers, even with a full-time job. Finally, the South African government has largely failed in the implementation of labour laws. The South African justice system fails frequently, making it one of the crime capitals of the world. Additionally, government efficiency is significantly hindered by endemic corruption, which fuels policy decisions that are often more advantageous for government officials than they are for citizens. Consequently, mistreatment of employees and strong-arming employees into silence to disincentivize legal action and accountability has become the norm, and the mechanisms in place designed to deal with this are often inaccessible or ineffective. Worker rights in South Africa, while somewhat enshrined in law, have been forgotten or abused in practice, an issue which has existed for much of South Africa’s dark history and remains as a part of the legacy of a deeply divided state. The path forward for South Africa is a long one, and will require a shift in the way the country views labour and values upliftment of disadvantaged communities.

    "title": "Minimum Wage Sick Days and the Problems With Worker's Rights",
    "body": "2023/02/22 - Though we view the United States as a whole, labor laws vary from state to state, and many simply chalk these variances up to differences in political parties. Yet, labor laws in blue-dominated states do not necessarily trump those of the red ones. The upshot: no matter the political party, most states fall well short of offering workers the rights they need. Take minimum wage for example. In New York, a traditionally blue state, workers must make a minimum of $14. 20 per hour, while in Texas, a traditionally red state, the minimum wage is $7. 25 an hour. The latter seems particularly low. Minimum wage workers in Texas make an average of $58 a day, with their salary totaling around $15,080 per year – well below MIT’s designated livable wage of $34,132. 80 for a single adult without children in Texas. However, the situation in New York isn’t much better. A minimum wage worker there would make $29,536 a year, which is still far below the livable wage of $44,636. 80. When taking into account living expenses, New York and Texas are not so different after all – both fail to provide the minimum to support their residents’ livelihoods. Wages are not the only problem at hand for workers. Sick days are also an essential part of having a stable job, as anyone who caught Covid during the past three years knows well. In Texas, workers are not legally entitled to sick days and are not compensated for them. Surprisingly, this fact is true for workers in New York state as well and seems particularly problematic, considering the low wages and high living expenses that residents of the state face. The absence of paid leave forces workers to choose between staying home while sick or making enough money to get by – options that are impossible to pick between. Obviously, problems with workers’ rights are found in both Democratic and Republican states and go much deeper than political affiliation. The common misconception of labor laws is that they are regulated better in blue states than in red states, but a simple comparison of New York and Texas quickly debunks this idea. The reason for this is that, most often, the cost of living is not taken into consideration when looking at a minimum wage. Even though we view New York as a very liberal state, the disparities between income and spending show that the state must do better to ensure that workers are treated fairly.

    "title": "Inequalities in the AI industry",
    "body": "2023/02/22 - The AI industry, like many technology sectors, has faced criticism for a lack of diversity and unequal treatment of certain groups. This can manifest in a variety of ways, such as diversity and inclusion, bias in AI systems, and job automation. The AI industry has a significant lack of diversity, especially in leadership positions and technical roles. This leads to a homogeneous culture and limited perspectives in the development and deployment of AI systems. Research has shown that the AI workforce is predominantly male and from certain ethnic and cultural backgrounds, which can lead to bias in the development and deployment of AI systems. To address this problem, many companies and organizations are taking steps to increase diversity and inclusivity in the AI industry, such as through initiatives aimed at recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups and promoting equal opportunities in the workplace. The increasing use of AI and automation technologies in various industries has led to job automation, where tasks previously performed by humans are now being carried out by machines or algorithms. While this has brought many benefits, such as increased efficiency and lower costs, it has also had an impact on employment, as some jobs are becoming obsolete. However, it is important to note that AI and automation are also creating new jobs in fields such as data science, machine learning, and software development. Additionally, some experts believe that AI could potentially enhance existing jobs by allowing workers to focus on more creative and higher-value tasks. Nevertheless, the impact of AI and automation on employment is a complex issue that requires ongoing attention and investment in workforce development and training programs. Bias in AI systems refers to the phenomenon where an algorithm or model shows unfair or discriminatory behavior towards certain groups of people based on factors such as race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. This can occur due to a number of reasons, such as the use of biased data in training models, the choice of algorithms or features that reinforce existing biases, or the lack of diversity among the individuals developing and deploying the AI systems. Bias in AI systems can have serious consequences, including discrimination in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice. To address this problem, it is important to have diverse teams working on AI development and deployment, to use unbiased training data, and to regularly evaluate and test AI systems for bias. There is also a growing body of research in the field of fair AI, which aims to develop methods for creating AI systems that are equitable and unbiased. When there is a divide between those who have access to AI technologies and those who do not, the widening of the digital divide and unequal distribution of the benefits of AI will surely. Unequal access to AI technologies refers to the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities for individuals and organizations to use and benefit from AI. This can be due to factors such as geographic location, financial resources, technical expertise, and access to data, leading to disparities in the development and deployment of AI solutions. The lack of equal access to AI technologies can result in a widening of the digital divide and exacerbate existing socio-economic inequalities. Addressing this challenge requires collaboration and investment from governments, private organizations, and the wider AI community. Addressing these inequalities in the AI industry requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including companies, governments, and communities, to promote diversity and inclusion, provide reskilling and job opportunities, reduce bias in AI systems, and ensure equitable access to AI technologies.

    "title": "Minimum Wage Sick Days and the Problems With Worker's Rights",
    "body": "2023/02/21 - Though we view the United States as a whole, labor laws vary from state to state, and many simply chalk these variances up to differences in political parties. Yet, labor laws in blue-dominated states do not necessarily trump those of the red ones. The upshot: no matter the political party, most states fall well short of offering workers the rights they need. Take minimum wage for example. In New York, a traditionally blue state, workers must make a minimum of $14. 20 per hour, while in Texas, a traditionally red state, the minimum wage is $7. 25 an hour. The latter seems particularly low. Minimum wage workers in Texas make an average of $58 a day, with their salary totaling around $15,080 per year – well below MIT’s designated livable wage of $34,132. 80 for a single adult without children in Texas. However, the situation in New York isn’t much better. A minimum wage worker there would make $29,536 a year, which is still far below the livable wage of $44,636. 80. When taking into account living expenses, New York and Texas are not so different after all – both fail to provide the minimum to support their residents’ livelihoods. Wages are not the only problem at hand for workers. Sick days are also an essential part of having a stable job, as anyone who caught Covid during the past three years knows well. In Texas, workers are not legally entitled to sick days and are not compensated for them. Surprisingly, this fact is true for workers in New York state as well and seems particularly problematic, considering the low wages and high living expenses that residents of the state face. The absence of paid leave forces workers to choose between staying home while sick or making enough money to get by – options that are impossible to pick between. Obviously, problems with workers’ rights are found in both Democratic and Republican states and go much deeper than political affiliation. The common misconception of labor laws is that they are regulated better in blue states than in red states, but a simple comparison of New York and Texas quickly debunks this idea. The reason for this is that, most often, the cost of living is not taken into consideration when looking at a minimum wage. Even though we view New York as a very liberal state, the disparities between income and spending show that the state must do better to ensure that workers are treated fairly. Of course, that goes for Texas too.

    "body": "2022/11/30 - Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman, died in custody on September 16, 2022. Iranian authorities arrested and transported her to a detention center because she did not completely cover her hair with her hijab, which violated Iran’s strict Islamic clothing regulations. Three days after her detainment, she died inside a hospital. Police claim that this sudden death was due to underlying health problems and a heart attack, but according to Amini’s parents, their daughter was in perfect health before the incident. Witnesses claim that they saw authorities beating her as they took her away, which aroused widespread controversy and protests In response to Mahsa Amini’s death, Iranian residents who believe that Amini’s death was not an accident flooded the streets in protest. This sudden resistance of the people is extremely monumental and rare for modern-day Iran. Iran ranks #178 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, suggesting a reserved culture with strong religious regulations. However, Iranian women began to break free from the past traditions by marching in protest and burning their hijabs in public in response to the death of Mahsa Amini. The popular chant, “Women, Life, Freedom,” is often used in both the streets of Iran and online in an attempt to shed light on the situation in Iran. In addition to in person protests, the Iranians used the internet as an outlet to further their ideas and convey their stance on the issue despite government censorship. Through the internet, non-Iranians have also discovered Amini’s story and started to post pictures of themselves cutting their hair in solidarity. As a result of the efforts, the issue spread overseas and protests emerged abroad in places such as Istanbul, Madrid, and New York. Amini’s death has broken the hearts of many people from different backgrounds, as it portrayed another example of a government making decisions that many considers as against moral principals. However, it has also opened people’s eyes to some of the horrors that occur when the government interweaves religion with everyday life. This event caused a roaring call for change in society from many, and these women will continue to voice their opposition to the government until Iran transforms for the better. We can only hope that this thorn of lasting pain changes into a blossoming new flower of the future for Iran. Written by Aava Ghorbanian "

    "title": "Women's Rights: Movements",
    "body": "2022/11/29 - Throughout history, there have been similar protests for women’s rights to the ones happening in Iran. While there are so many, the mentioned below are some of the more well known movements: Suffrage MovementIn 1848, The Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York, led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, sparked the beginning of the Suffrage Movement. Over 300 people, mostly women, attended the convention. They created the Document of Sentiments and Grievances, modeling it after the Declaration of Independence, asserting gender equality between men and women. With the belief that women deserve political power just like men, the suffragists became more active in the 1900s through mass protests and picketing. As the United States entered World War I, women began to take jobs that men left behind, leading President Woodrow Wilson to understand the importance of women in modern day society. Decades after the 14th and 15th amendments granted male’s suffrage rights, President Wilson proposed the 19th amendment that enfranchised suffrage rights to women, which was finally passed in 1920 and brought an end to the suffrage movement and gave women the rights they had been fighting for. Women’s Liberation Movement: Bra Burning at the Miss America PageantThe Women’s Liberation Movement was a far reaching and international fight for women’s rights, held from the 1960s-1980s. Specifically, in the United States, liberationists protested against the Miss America Pageant for the objectification of women’s bodies, which viewed women as mere objects to men’s sexual desires instead of people. The liberationists protested at a pageant being held in New Jersey, throwing their bras, lipsticks, high heels, and more, into a trash can, labeled the “Freedom Trash Can”. While the event was known for the burning of the can, the fire was reported to be accidental and put out quickly. However, the extinguishing of the fire does not extinguish the efforts and spirit of the women who showed up and fought for their rights. Take Back the NightTake Back the Night is an organization that had its first event in England in 1877, where women protested for the violence and fear they felt as they walked at night. As this movement gained popularity, it spread to the United States. For example, in 1972, women marched through the University of Southern Florida campus, demanding more resources for their education. In 1978, Take Back the Night marched once again in San Francisco to protest against the snuff pornography being distributed and the women being murdered for it. Then, again in 1975, Susan Alexander Speeth was murdered while walking back home, sparking another march against the unsafety women experience at night. At the International Tribunal on Crimes Against Women convention in Belgium, women marched with candles to fight for the ability to walk the streets at night safely and without fear. All those events aimed to earn security for women, and in the 21st century, Take Back the Night still continues to empower women and protect them against sexual injustice. Women2Drive MovementIn Saudi Arabia, the government placed a ban to prevent women from driving in 1957, becoming the only country that denies women the right to drive motor vehicles. Reacting to this injustice, people fought to revoke this ban, initiating the Women2Drive movement in November 1990, where 47 women drove through Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. They were arrested and had their passports taken away from them, but their drive was enough to spark a new movement. Then, on October 26, 2013, despite being warned of arrest, groups of women took to the streets once again; this time, without arrests. In November 2014, Lujain al-Hathoul also attempted to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates, but she was arrested for 70 days, along with al-Sharif, who had come to help her. Finally, as the movement became more and more publicized, the ban was finally lifted in June 2018, giving the women of Saudi Arabia the right to drive. March for Women’s RightsIn 2003, the Partial-Birth Abortion Act was passed, banning intact dilation and extraction, which was a surgical procedure that removes a fetus from a uterus. This procedure was used in the situation of a miscarriage or an abortion in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. With the new act banning this procedure, it limited women’s freedom and their access to safe healthcare, endangering their lives. As a show of unity and spirit against this act, around 1. 3 million people showed up to the March for Women’s Rights event on April 25, 2004. It was held in Washington, D. C. on the National Mall. This protest was organized by several associations like Planned Parenthood, NOW, Black Women’s Health Imperative, Feminist Majority, NARAL, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and ACLU. While they were unable to achieve their goal of rescinding the act, it showed the determination of the pro-choice movement.

    "title": "Religious and Government Separation",
    "body": "2022/11/29 - A hijab is a head covering worn by Muslim women, mandated by law in majority of the Middle Eastern countries, like Iran and Afghanistan. The recent death of Mahsa Amini in Morality Police custody brought religious laws like these into question. It also sparks controversy, as it forces us to reconcile the role religions should play in nations. All in all, religion and state should separate, because people can control governments, but not religion. Government is fluid while religion is set in stone. Binding religion with government infringes on people’s political freedom, as the Guardian council in the Iranian government shows. It is composed of the top twelve members of the Shia clergy who use their power to dampen reformist influence in the Iranian government. For example, in 2004, the council barred more than 3,600 reformist-independent candidates from participating in elections. It also routinely cancels votes from reformist districts. Clearly, the guardian council, a religious voice in the Iranian government, uses its influence to increase bipartisan control in Iranian politics. And though the Guardian Council and other religious elements in the government appear to be conservative, the reality is that it is simply unadaptable. Religion can’t change, because dogma in itself is a set of rules to obey by. In this clash of religious code and political law, religion will always interfere with the government because it itself is a governance, in a sense. The consequence of this clash of interest is limited political freedom to all. This undermines equality in political participation and freedom, continuing the pattern that leads to further corruption and suppression of the citizens’ voices, as we can see through the case of Mahsa Amini. Religious governance also jeopardizes citizens’ religious freedom. In medieval Europe, for instance, the power of Catholic Christanity is ubiquitous, though many monarchs taint this power by their cruelness. King Ferdinand II of Aragon exemplifies this, establishing the Spanish Inquisition in 1478 to try heretics among the Jews and Muslims who recently converted to Christanity. In addition, King Charles IX of France instigated the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre after ordering the assassination of Protestant leaders in France. Moreover, fear and mob mentality influenced civil and religious courts, leading to mass prosecutions of people suspected of witchcraft, which resulted in over 60,000 deaths. In the context of medieval violence and social unrest, having a state affiliated with religion defeats the purpose of government as agents for stability, because the government becomes biased against minority religion groups. The absolutist rulers who get power from divine ordain have numerous means to appropriate certain changes in their state. They frequently prosecute religious minorities to appeal to the religious majority, thus consolidating their power. Absolutist power magnifies the destructive effects of discriminatory laws and royal decrees while Local power bends heavily toward religious law. This jeopardizes the religious freedom of all. In contrast, a government whose power doesn’t depend on religion has nothing to justify their rule unless the subjects - citizens - agree that governance is mutually beneficial. The government must change and adapt to the citizens or face rebellion and disloyalty. An example of this is Democracy. In it, candidates for positions of power are decided by popularity, not religion, which promotes a constant state of change within the government, and prevents prolonged abuses of power. A government that does not identify with any religion is also more religiously free because without the intervention of a main state religion, people tend to choose religions that suit them the most, knowing at least they won’t be politically penalized. Religion and government are incompatible, though religion is a broad term that defines much more than the examples mentioned above. “Religion” as a noun has a specific definition, but you can be “religiously” committed to many things. In the context of government, you can expand the meaning of the word to include atheism, societal ownership of means of production (socialism), personality cults (Stalin, Mao), confucianism, and so on, goals that governments are so vested in that they act similarly to religious states in dedication and sometimes, cruelty. Religion and state must separate, but we should also be aware of the danger of religious devotion elsewhere, for, the government serves the people first, not their obsessions.

    "title": "Religion and Human Rights",
    "body": "2022/11/29 - The recent event of Mahsa Amini has left room for debate of what takes precedence nationwide: religion or human rights. Religion is a system of attitudes, beliefs, and practices (Marriam-Webster), and its priority in government affairs has been debated for thousands of years. While some believe that faith is more important than the fundamental human rights that belong to all persons (Marriam-Webster), others disagree. Countries like the United States place individual rights before religious practices, while others, like Iran, integrate faith into their laws and daily practices. The United States has been a secular country since its independence, meaning that religion is not a considered factor when passing laws or verdicts in court. An individual’s faith may not impact any decision at the legal level and may not be the cause of any discrimination. In the United States, the government remains unbiased in all of its legal and political decisions, protecting people’s rights over religion regardless of one’s belief. For example, according to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers may not consider religion when hiring, firing, or making any other decisions in the workplace. It also states that employers must accommodate employees’ religious beliefs and practices, which protects people’s right of freedom of religion (United States Department of Labor). Overall, the United States prioritizes human rights over religion. Contrary to the United States, religion often outweighs human rights in Iran. Since its establishment, Iran has been an Islamic country. Government officials take Islamic doctrines into account with every decision they make, incorporating religion into the laws. A 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom states that Iran has been a “Country of Particular Concern” (U. S. Department of State) since 1999 for violating the International Freedom Act of 1998, by suppressing other minority religious groups. In fact, the Iranian government does not tolerate the practice of any religion other than Islam, and strictly enforces rules set by the Quran - define Quran (U. S. Department of State). The recent death of Mahsa Amini reflects the severe consequences for those who violate Islamic law, further emphasizes the importance of Islam in the Iranian government. Women who improperly wear their hijab face serious penalties, and the government often disregards opposition to the dress code. In Iran, religion, specifically Islam, greatly overshadows human rights. The importance of religion and human rights varies from countries , with some like the United States that encourage the free practice of one’s faith and some like Iran that strictly enforce rules based on a certain religion. This debate puts in perspective the priorities of a country and leaves one wondering how far a country will go to govern its people based on that priority.

    "body": "2022/11/29 - Women’s subordination within our patriarchal society originated from the labor division during the Neolithic Era, where women assumed a domestic role, while men acted as the providers for households. As our societies developed, new forms of sexual discrimination and unequal treatments continued this subordination. For example, during the industrial revolution, women faced a limited choice of employment of mainly teachers and servants, while men took on other employment opportunities, like farmers and craftsmen. In the present day, the increasing influence of feminism has led women to fight for their rights and freedom, and their effort have only been successful through the hard work and perseverance of many brave advocates and martyrs. For the past centuries, many countries continue to oppress women’s rights. Iran, also known as the Islamic Republic, has been one of the most restrictive countries on women’s rights. In a recent report made by the World Economic Forum, rating countries on the “economic participation, educational attainment, health, and political survival of women” (Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty), Iran ranked 143 out of 146 countries. The statistics were especially poor in the categories of Economic Participation and Opportunity and Political Empowerment. In 2021, only 6% of the seats in the Iranian parliament were held by women. In 2020, only 19% of senior and middle management positions consisted of women. These sets of reported data show the limitations women face in politics and economics. However, the issue at hand is due to the oppressive social dress codes enforced by government and patriarchal policies, giving the women of Iran no room for freedom. Currently, in support of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was recently made a martyr for women’s rights, people around the world have risen up to fight against the oppression placed on women in Iran. After being violently arrested by the morality police and beaten for breaching hijab dress codes, Amini died in the hospital. According to state news, she reportedly went into cardiac arrest, falling into a coma. However, her mother reported that Amini was only 22 and was in perfect health, making it likely that the true cause of her death was due to the torture she experienced in police custody. Following Amini’s death, protests spread quickly through the power of social media, inspiring many youths to participate in these rallies and connect to fights against the unjust towards women. Many of them show their support by defying hijab laws, like removing their hijabs, burning them, and waving their hijabs in the air with their hair uncovered. In response to these protests, the government has reacted through gun usage, surveillance, and internet restrictions, leading to many injuries and thousands of fatalities. Security forces have raided schools across the country in order to contain the protests, resulting in hundreds of people, including children, being killed, with even more injured. Additionally, among the 15,000 people detained, the average age of the protesters is 15 years old. As protests in Iran continue for more than eight weeks, people around the world show support through their own rallies and spread the topic on social media. In order to liberate the women of Iran and bring global equality, we must continue to address the protests in Iran, while showing one stance of unity against the oppression they face.

Since ancient times, abortions have been performed through a number of methods. Common practices include herbal abortifacients, sharp tools, or traditional medicine that date back to ancient China, Egypt, India, and the Roman Empire. With abortion’s extensive history in so many cultures, it is no surprise that laws were also put in place regarding this practice. At different points in time, Japan, China, India, and ancient Rome all had bans placed on abortions with varying levels of severity. But why do people ban abortions? Religious followers vehemently quote from the Old Testament, which states that life starts at conception; thus, aborting a fetus would result in murder. Some medical scholars refer to the Hippocratic Oath, stating that it prevents them from performing abortions. Even today, anti-abortionists sport a wide range of reasons that only they can justify. In this month’s issue, we address today’s most pressing issue regarding abortion: Roe v. Wade. You will get to read the two sides of this topic, as well as a timeline regarding the history of abortion, and eventually form your own educated opinion on the ethics of abortion. "

    "body": "2022/09/10 - The Reconstruction Era, a nationwide effort to rebuild and stabilize the country after the Civil War and assimilate freed slaves into society with their newly conferred rights, had officially ended in 1877, a little over a decade before. Yet, this new withdrawal of Northern troops and influence from the south led to the rise of what we know today to be the Era of Jim Crow. In 1890, the state of Louisiana passed the Separate Car Act, requiring all railroads to provide train cars that were “separate but [had] equal accommodations” which would segregate black passengers from whites. This was following a chain of similar bills in neighboring states, after Florida took the lead by passing the first law dictating that railroad cars must be segregated in 1887. In resistance to the Separate Car Act, Homer Adolph Plessy pulled a “Rosa Parks. ” Or rather, Rosa Parks was the one who pulled a “Plessy” several decades later. On June 7th, 1892, Plessy took a train, sat down on the car for whites, refused to leave, and was subsequently arrested. While being tried for violating the Separate Car Act, Plessy countered by claiming that the law was unconstitutional and it infringed on the 14th Amendment which guaranteed freed slaves citizenship, rights, and equal protection. (The judge presiding over his case was Hon. John Ferguson, hence the name, Plessy v. Ferguson. ) Four years later, after a series of court battles, the case finally made it way up to the Supreme Court, where the court ruled in a landmark case that “separate but equal” was constitutional. They argued that the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment, which mandates that states cannot discriminate against individuals based on unrelated differences, does not apply to “social rights. ” With this case, the Supreme Court constitutionalized segregation, and it marked the rise of Jim Crow laws. The case was not overturned until 1954, with the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, which ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Plessy v. Ferguson remains today as one of the most notable cases concerning social rights in American history. One of the conservative justices, Samuel Alito, who voted in favor of Roe v. Wade’s overturning, refers to Plessy v. Ferguson as an example of an “egregiously wrong” decision and compares it to Roe v. Wade, calling them both unconstitutional “from the day it was decided. ” What he doesn’t seem to accept is that Plessy’s case legalized segregation and took away countless rights of blacks for decades, while Roe v. Wade protected women’s rights and its recent overturning in favor of fetal rights proves the opposite effect. These two landmark decisions both had lasting effects on American society and history. While Plessy forced an uphill battle for the rights of millions of black Americans in the 20th century, we can only wait to see whether or not Roe’s overturning will follow similar historical trends.

Some statistics for you…24 countries prohibit abortion41 allow abortion to save a woman’s life48 allow abortion to preserve health13 allow abortion on socioeconomic grounds75 allow abortion on request (with gestational limits) Countries included:  China India USA Indonesia Pakistan Nigeria Brazil Bangladesh Russia MexicoThe following timeline illustrates abortion rights in the top 10 most populous countries throughout the 19th-21st centuries: In conclusion…ChinaAbortion is accessible to all women, in public and private hospitals countrywide. There is not much debate surrounding the morality of it, as traditional Chinese beliefs perceive the right to live as starting at birth. IndiaAbortion is legal for rape victims and in case of severe fetal anomaly, but it requires a long process of approval, resulting in it being inaccessible to many people. U. S. The legality of abortion depends on the states. As of now, many states are split between protecting abortion and making it illegal. IndonesiaAbortion is legal in medical emergencies, as well as in cases of severe fetal anomaly. It’s also legal for cases of rape before six weeks of gestation have passed. The process is severely complicated and ambiguous, and many people are unable to obtain an abortion. For every 100,000 live births, there are 305 maternal deaths. PakistanPolicies are generally against abortion, except in ambiguous cases of “good faith” or “necessary treatment”. Many women attempt to get unsafe abortions, which majorly contributes to avoidable injuries and death. In 2002, 197,000 women were estimated to have been hospitalized for unsafe abortion complications. NigeriaAbortion laws in Nigeria have not changed since 1861. They remain illegal, unless done to save the life of a pregnant woman. Around 50. 6 per 1,000 women of reproductive age attempt to get an abortion, making it one of the highest rates in the world. BrazilMany women attempt to buy Misoprostol on the black market in order to get an illegal abortion. Abortion is legal only to save a woman’s life, or if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest. Unsafe abortions are the fourth leading cause of maternal deaths in the country. BangladeshAbortion is only legal to save a woman’s life. However, Menstrual Regulation, which is used to bring back regular menstruation, is available. Many women are unaware of this, and gestational limits are unclear, which causes many people to be incorrectly denied when attempting to find Menstrual Regulation care. RussiaAbortion is legal on request until the 12th week of pregnancy, and it is also available in later pregnancies under special circumstances. MexicoThere are no national-level regulations on abortion. 8 out of 32 states, as well as Mexico City, are working on providing safe paths to abortion. what can you do?: You can visit https://reproductiverights. org/get-involved/ to learn more about abortion, and how you can act on it.

    "title": " Roe v. Wade: How was the Decision Made?",
    "body": "2022/09/02 - Roe v. Wade was a legal decision made by the supreme court in 1973, striking down the Texas statute of criminalizing abortion. The decision made the statement that a woman’s right to abortion is part of the privacy that is protected in the 14th amendment. Before Roe v. Wade, states placed heavy restrictions on abortions, many of them illegalizing them. In 1970, Norma McCorvey, a. k. a Jane Roe (to preserve privacy), took federal action against Henry Rade, who was the district attorney of Dallas county in Texas. The question was “Does the Constitution recognize a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy by abortion?” Roe asserted that she had an absolute right to terminate her pregnancy at any time, but the Supreme Court disagreed, trying to balance a woman’s right of privacy as well as trying to regulate abortion. Finally, the Supreme Court decided to place a point in the pregnancy; after a certain amount of time, no more abortion would be allowed. They set this point at around 24 weeks of pregnancy, meaning that before 24 weeks, women were allowed to have abortions legally. There have been repeated challenges against Roe v. Wade from 1973 to before 2022, but none succeeded in overturning it, but managed to narrow the scope further. On Friday, June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, removing 50 years of legal protection for abortion rights. This left abortion laws and restrictions to the states. Because of laws that were put into place before the ruling, abortion is now outlawed in many states. As of now, Idaho, Texas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia have banned abortion. Georgia has stated that any abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy are illegal, while Utah, North Carolina, and Florida have stated that abortions after 20 weeks are illegal. In California, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, New Mexico, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maine, abortions are completely legal. In Nevada, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, abortions are legal but limited. For Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and South Carolina, bans are being considered but are not in place yet. "
